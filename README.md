#INTRODUCING
This is the first approach to the use of the GIT world, in particular I'll
explain every passage about my first bot's building.
For a beginner it seems a little hard the first approach but I learn a lot of
things thanks to Google and a friend of mine.

So...let's start

##CREATE A  NEW PROJECT
*Add a newfolder called 'trybot' in my PC.
*I open GitHub and create a new project.
*I called my new repository 'trybot', adding a description and I picked on
 'public' button.
*I create a new repository.
